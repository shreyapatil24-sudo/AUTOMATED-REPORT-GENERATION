# MY PROJECT IS ABOUT AUTOMATED REPORT GNERATION
I am currently pursuing a Python programming internship, and as part of my second assignment, I developed a project titled “Automated Report Generation.” The main idea behind this project is to automatically create structured and professional reports from raw sales data using Python.

In many companies, reports are still prepared manually using tools like Excel or Word. This process takes time and can lead to mistakes in calculations or formatting. To solve this problem, I built a system that reads sales data from a file, performs necessary calculations, and generates a well-formatted PDF report automatically within seconds.

This project was developed using Python and executed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It helped me understand how automation can make business processes faster, easier, and more accurate.

Objectives of the Project

The main goals of this project were:

To understand how file handling works in Python.

To learn how to read and process data from a CSV file.

To perform calculations like total and average using Python.

To generate a professional PDF report automatically.

To apply Python concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in using Python for automation tasks.

Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies were used:

Python 3.x – Main programming language.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Code editor used for writing and running the program.

CSV Module – Used to read sales data from a CSV file.

FPDF Library – Used to generate the PDF report.

Python was chosen because it is simple, easy to understand, and widely used for automation and data processing tasks.

Working of the Project

The project works in four main steps:

1. Data Collection

The sales data is stored in a file named sales_data.csv.
This file contains information such as:

Name of the salesperson

Sales amount

This file acts as the input source for the project.

2. Data Reading

The Python program reads the CSV file using the built-in csv module.
Each row in the file is read and stored in a list for processing.

3. Data Analysis

After reading the data, the program performs important calculations such as:

Total sales of all employees

Average sales

Identification of the top seller (the employee with the highest sales)

These calculations are done using simple Python functions like sum(), len(), and max().

4. Report Generation

After completing the calculations, the program generates a professional PDF report using the FPDF library.

The generated report includes:

A title (Sales Report)

A table showing each salesperson’s sales

Total sales

Average sales

Name of the top performer

The report is automatically saved as Sales_Report.pdf in the project folder.

Features of the Project

Fully automated report generation

Quick and efficient processing

Accurate calculations

Professional PDF format

Easy to modify for other types of reports

No manual work required after running the script

Advantages

Saves time and effort

Reduces chances of human error

Can handle large amounts of data

Improves productivity

Can be reused for multiple reporting needs

Applications

This system can be used in:

Business organizations

Sales departments

Educational institutions

Inventory management systems

Financial reporting systems

It can also be modified to generate:

Student performance reports

Attendance reports

Employee salary reports

Inventory stockreports

The Automated Report Generation project helped me understand how Python can be used to automate real-world tasks. By reading data from a file, analyzing it, and generating a professional PDF report automatically, the system removes the need for manual report preparation.

This project improved my understanding of file handling, data processing, automation, and PDF generation in Python. It also showed me how programming can simplify business operations and increase efficiency.
